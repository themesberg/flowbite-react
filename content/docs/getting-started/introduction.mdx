[Flowbite React](https://github.com/themesberg/flowbite-react) is a free and open-source UI component library based on the core Flowbite components and built with React components and interactivity handling.

This library features hundreds of interactive elements such as navbars, dropdowns, modals, and sidebars all handled by React and based on the utility classes from Tailwind CSS.

## Getting started

Learn how to get started with Flowbite React and start leveraging the interactive React components coupled with Flowbite and Tailwind CSS.

You'll need to be familiar with Node.js and `npm`, and have `npm` installed. You should be comfortable installing packages with `npm`, and experience creating web apps with React and Tailwind CSS will be very helpful.

### Setup Tailwind CSS

Install Tailwind CSS:

```bash
npm i autoprefixer postcss tailwindcss
npx tailwindcss init -p
```

Point Tailwind CSS to files you have `className=".."` in:

```javascript
module.exports = {
  content: ['./src/**/*.{js,jsx,ts,tsx}' /* src folder, for example */],
  theme: {
    extend: {},
  },
  plugins: [],
};
```

Add Tailwind CSS to a CSS file:

```css
@tailwind base;
@tailwind components;
@tailwind utilities;
```

### Install Flowbite React

1. Run the following command to install `flowbite-react`:

```bash
npm i flowbite-react
```

2. Add the Flowbite plugin to `tailwind.config.js`, and include content from `flowbite-react`:

```js
/** @type {import('tailwindcss').Config} */
export default {
  content: [
    // ...
    'node_modules/flowbite-react/lib/esm/**/*.js',
  ],
  plugins: [
    // ...
    require('flowbite/plugin'),
  ],
};
```

### Try it out

How you use Flowbite React depends on your project setup. In general, you can just import the components you want to use from `flowbite-react` and use them in a React `.jsx` file:

```jsx
import { Button } from 'flowbite-react';

export default function MyPage() {
  return (
    <div>
      <Button>Click me</Button>
    </div>
  );
}
```
