description: Get started with the rating component from Flowbite React to show testimonials and user reviews of your products using stars, labels and advanced layouts
---

The rating component can be used to show user reviews and testimonials in the form of stars, reviews, and labels based on multiple styles and layouts built with React and Tailwind CSS.

Check out the rating components from Flowbite React and choose one that suits your needs and customize them using the custom props API and the utility classes from Tailwind CSS.

Start using the rating component by importing it from the `flowbite-react` library:

```jsx
import { Rating } from 'flowbite-react';
```

## Default rating

Use this example to show a list of star elements that can be either filled or not to indicate the average user reviews of a product by using the `filled` prop from React on the `<Rating>` component.

<Example name="rating.root" />

## Rating with text

This example can be used to show a text label next to the user review stars to indicate the average score.

<Example name="rating.withText" />

## Rating count

Use this example to show the number of reviews a product received next to the average stars and scores.

<Example name="rating.count" />

## Star sizing

The `size` prop can be used on the `<Rating>` component to customize the default size of the rating component. You can choose from `md` or `lg` and the default is `sm`.

<Example name="rating.sizing" />

## Advanced rating

Use this component as an advanced layout for user ratings that include both the average score, total rating count, and a percentage filled progress bar to indicate in depth statistics of how many reviews were received for each score category.

<Example name="rating.advanced" />
