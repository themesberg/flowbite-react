Use the popover component to show detailed information inside a pop-up box relative to the element that is being clicked or hovered based on multiple styles

Get started with the popover component to show any type of content inside a pop-up box when hovering or clicking over a trigger element. There are multiple examples that you can choose from, such as showing more information about a user profile, company profile, password strength, and more.

Before using the popover component, make sure to import the component in your React project:

```jsx
import { Popover } from 'flowbite-react';
```

## Default popover

Wrap the trigger component with the `<Popover>` component and pass the popover content to the `content` prop of the `<Popover>` component.

This will render the popover whenever you click the trigger component.

<Example name="popover.root" />

## Company profile

This example can be used to show more information about a company profile.

<Example name="popover.profile" />

## Image popover

Use this example to trigger a popover component with detailed information and an image when hovering over a portion of highlighted text inspired by Wikipedia and other large news outlets.

<Example name="popover.image" />

## Password strength

Dynamically show the password strength progress when creating a new password positioned relative to the input element.

<Example name="popover.password" />

## Controlled

Manages visibility via `open` and `openOnChange` props, allowing fine-tuned control over its display. Ideal for scenarios where Popover behavior needs to align with specific application logic or user interactions.

<Example name="popover.controlled" />

## Placement

Update the placement of the popover using the `placement` prop. The default placement is `bottom` and you can also use `right`, `top`, and `left`.

<Example name="popover.placement" />

## Trigger type

Use the `trigger` prop to change the trigger type of the popover if you want to show the popover when clicking on the hover element instead of clicking on it.

The default trigger type is `hover` and you can also use `click`.

<Example name="popover.trigger" />

## Disable arrow

You can disable the arrow of the popover component by passing the `arrow` prop with a value of `false`.

<Example name="popover.disableArrow" />
