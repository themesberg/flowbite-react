description: Get started with the table component to show data such as text, numbers, images, and links using a structured set of data based on rows and columns based on React
---

The table component is an important UI component that you can use to effectively show complex amounts of data in the form of numbers, text, images, buttons, and links inside a structured layout of rows and columns.

Use the custom React components from Flowbite and the API reference of props to customize the table layout and content and the utility classes from Tailwind CSS to update the styles.

Start using the table component by importing it from the `flowbite-react` library:

```jsx
import { Table } from "flowbite-react";
```

## Default table

Use this example to show a responsive table component with table head and body featuring cells and rows on multiple levels by using the `<Table>` React component and the children components such as `<TableHead>`, `<TableBody>`, `<TableRow>` and `<TableCell>`.

<Example name="table.root" />

## Striped rows

Use the `striped` React prop on the `<Table>` component to alternate the background of every second row of the table to increase contrast and readability.

<Example name="table.striped" />

## Table hover state

Add the `hoverable` prop to the `<Table>` React component to show a hover effect when moving the mouse over a table row. This also helps with readability.

<Example name="table.hover" />

## Table with checkboxes

Use this example to show multiple checkbox form elements for each table row that you can use when performing bulk actions.

<Example name="table.withCheckboxes" />

## Theme
