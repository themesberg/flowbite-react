## Configuration File

The `.flowbite-react/config.json` file is a central configuration file that controls how Flowbite React generates and manages component styles. This guide explains its structure, features, and how it affects your application's behavior.

### Schema

The configuration file follows this JSON Schema:

```json
{
  "$schema": "http://json-schema.org/draft-07/schema#",
  "type": "object",
  "properties": {
    "components": {
      "description": "List of component names to generate styles for. Empty array enables automatic detection.",
      "type": "array",
      "items": {
        "type": "string",
        "enum": [
          "*"
          // ...rest of the components
        ]
      },
      "uniqueItems": true
    },
    "path": {
      "description": "Path where components will be created, relative to the project root",
      "type": "string",
      "default": "src/components"
    },
    "prefix": {
      "description": "Optional prefix to apply to all Tailwind CSS classes",
      "type": "string"
    },
    "rsc": {
      "description": "Whether to include the 'use client' directive for React Server Components",
      "type": "boolean",
      "default": true
    },
    "tsx": {
      "description": "Whether to use TypeScript (.tsx) or JavaScript (.jsx) for component creation",
      "type": "boolean",
      "default": true
    }
  },
  "required": ["components", "path", "prefix", "rsc", "tsx"]
}
```

### Properties

#### `components`

- Type: `string[]`
- Default: `[]`
- Description: List of component names to generate Tailwind CSS classes for.
  - When empty (`[]`), enables automatic component detection
  - When populated, disables automatic detection and only generates styles for listed components
  - Use `"*"` to explicitly include all components (equivalent to listing every component)
  - When not using `"*"`, use valid component names (e.g., `Button`, `Card`, `Modal`). See the [schema](https://unpkg.com/flowbite-react/schema.json) for the full list of valid components.

#### `path`

- Type: `string`
- Default: `"src/components"`
- Description: Path where components will be created, relative to the project root. Used by the CLI when creating new components.

#### `prefix`

- Type: `string`
- Default: `""`
- Description: Optional prefix to apply to all Tailwind CSS classes. Useful for avoiding class name conflicts.

For detailed instructions on configuring and using prefixes, see the [Prefix](/docs/customize/prefix) documentation.

#### `rsc`

- Type: `boolean`
- Default: `true`
- Description: Whether to include the 'use client' directive for React Server Components. When set to `true`, the "use client" directive will be added at the top of created component files.

#### `tsx`

- Type: `boolean`
- Default: `true`
- Description: Whether to use TypeScript (.tsx) or JavaScript (.jsx) for component creation. When set to `false`, components will be created with .jsx extension.

## Automatic Class Generation

The automatic class generation system works in two modes:

### 1. Automatic Mode (Default)

When `components` array is empty:

- Automatically scans your codebase for Flowbite React component imports
- Generates styles for all detected components and their dependencies
- Updates in real-time as you add/remove component imports
- Watches for file changes during development

Example config for automatic mode:

```json
{
  "$schema": "https://unpkg.com/flowbite-react/schema.json",
  "components": [],
  "path": "src/components",
  "prefix": "",
  "rsc": true,
  "tsx": true
}
```

### 2. Manual Mode

When `components` array contains component names:

- Disables automatic component detection
- Only generates styles for explicitly listed components
- Includes styles for component dependencies automatically
- Shows warning: "Components specified in config.json. Automatic class generation is disabled."

Example config for manual mode:

```json
{
  "$schema": "https://unpkg.com/flowbite-react/schema.json",
  "components": ["Button", "Card", "Modal"],
  "path": "src/components",
  "prefix": "",
  "rsc": true,
  "tsx": true
}
```

## Component Creation

The CLI uses the configuration file to determine how to create new components:

```bash
npx flowbite-react@latest create my-component
```

The component creation process is affected by these configuration options:

- `path`: Determines where the component will be created
- `rsc`: Determines whether to include the "use client" directive
- `tsx`: Determines whether to use TypeScript (.tsx) or JavaScript (.jsx)

For more information on creating custom components, see the [Custom Components](/docs/customize/custom-components) documentation.

## Build Process

The build process handles style generation differently based on your configuration:

### Development (`flowbite-react dev`)

1. Reads the `config.json` file
2. If `components` is empty:
   - Watches for component imports across your codebase
   - Updates class list in real-time as components are added/removed
   - Generates styles for all detected components
3. If `components` has entries:
   - Generates styles only for listed components
   - Does not watch for new component imports
   - Shows warning about disabled automatic generation

### Production (`flowbite-react build`)

1. Creates the `.flowbite-react` output directory if needed
2. Generates the final `class-list.json` containing:
   - All required Tailwind CSS classes
   - Classes for component dependencies
   - Prefixed classes if prefix is specified
3. Optimizes the class list by:
   - Removing duplicates
   - Sorting for consistency
   - Converting utilities to match your Tailwind version

## Component Dependencies

When generating styles, the system automatically includes dependencies:

- Each component may depend on other components
- Dependencies are defined in the `DEPENDENCY_LIST_MAP`
- When a component is included (either automatically or manually), all its dependencies are also included
- This ensures all necessary styles are available

## Best Practices

**1. Start with Automatic Mode**

- Leave `components` empty initially
- Let the system detect your usage
- Switch to manual mode if you need precise control

**2. Use Manual Mode When**

- You need to strictly control bundle size
- You want to ensure specific components are included
- You have complex dependency requirements

**3. Prefix Considerations**

- Use prefixes when integrating with other libraries
- Keep prefixes short but meaningful
- Consider your Tailwind version when choosing prefix format

**4. Component Creation Settings**

- Use `path` to organize components in your project structure
- Set `rsc` to `false` if you're not using React Server Components
- Set `tsx` to `false` if your project uses JavaScript instead of TypeScript
