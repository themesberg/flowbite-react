description: Learn how to configure and build a dark mode switcher for Flowbite using Tailwind CSS and start developing with the components from the library
---

`Flowbite React` comes with dark mode support out of the box, it supports integration with all full-stack frameworks such as `Next.js`, `Remix`, `Astro`, `Gatsby` that are using server-side rendering (SSR).

## Toggle dark mode

The `<DarkThemeToggle>` component will automatically detect the current theme and display the correct icon, and allow the user to switch between themes as they like.

```jsx
import { DarkThemeToggle } from "flowbite-react";

export default function MyPage() {
  return (
    // ...
    <DarkThemeToggle />
  );
}
```

### useThemeMode

`useThemeMode` is the hook reponsible for changing, detecting and persisting the theme mode.

Theme mode persistence is by default located in the browsers `LocalStorage`.

The `<DarkThemeToggle>` component uses `useThemeMode` hook under the hood.

```tsx
type ThemeMode = "light" | "dark" | "auto";

declare const useThemeMode: () => {
  mode: ThemeMode;
  computedMode: ThemeMode; // "light" | "dark"
  setMode: (mode: ThemeMode) => void;
  toggleMode: () => void;
  clearMode: () => void;
};
```

### Sync between tabs

The `useThemeMode` hook automatically keeps all tab instances in sync, no extra configuration needed.
