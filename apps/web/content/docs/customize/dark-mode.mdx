title: Dark Mode - Flowbite React
description: Learn how to implement and customize dark mode in your React application using Flowbite and Tailwind CSS. Includes step-by-step instructions for theme switching, SSR support, and framework-specific integrations.
---

## Overview

Flowbite React provides built-in dark mode functionality that seamlessly integrates with popular full-stack frameworks like Next.js, Remix, Astro, and Gatsby. The dark mode implementation fully supports server-side rendering (SSR) and offers an intuitive developer experience.

## Dark Mode Toggle

The easiest way to implement dark mode in your application is by using the `DarkThemeToggle` component. This component automatically handles theme detection and provides a user-friendly interface for switching between light and dark modes.

```jsx
import { DarkThemeToggle } from "flowbite-react";

export default function MyPage() {
  return (
    // ...
    <DarkThemeToggle />
  );
}
```

## Theme Mode Hook

For more granular control over theme management, Flowbite React provides the `useThemeMode` hook. This powerful hook handles:

- Theme state management
- Automatic theme detection
- Theme persistence in LocalStorage
- Cross-tab theme synchronization

### Hook API

```tsx
type ThemeMode = "light" | "dark" | "auto";

declare const useThemeMode: () => {
  mode: ThemeMode;
  computedMode: ThemeMode; // "light" | "dark"
  setMode: (mode: ThemeMode) => void;
  toggleMode: () => void;
  clearMode: () => void;
};
```

### Features

1. **Automatic Theme Persistence**: Your users' theme preferences are automatically saved in the browser's LocalStorage
2. **Cross-Tab Synchronization**: Theme changes are instantly synchronized across all open browser tabs
3. **No Additional Configuration**: All features work out of the box

## Disabling Dark Mode

To completely disable dark mode class generation in your Flowbite React application, you should use both of the following methods:

### 1. Using the ThemeConfig Component

First, disable dark mode at the application level by setting the `dark` prop to `false` in the `ThemeConfig` component:

```jsx
import { ThemeConfig } from "flowbite-react";

function App() {
  return (
    <>
      <ThemeConfig dark={false} />
      {/* Your application */}
    </>
  );
}
```

This approach prevents the dark mode toggle functionality from working in your application's runtime.

### 2. Using the Configuration File

Additionally, you must disable dark mode in your build configuration by setting the `dark` property to `false` in your `.flowbite-react/config.json` file:

```json {4}
{
  "$schema": "https://unpkg.com/flowbite-react/schema.json",
  "components": [],
  "dark": false,
  "path": "src/components",
  "prefix": "",
  "rsc": true,
  "tsx": true
}
```

This method prevents dark mode classes from being generated during the build process, which reduces your CSS bundle size.

> **Important**: For complete dark mode disabling, both methods should be used together. The ThemeConfig approach affects runtime behavior, while the config.json approach affects build-time class generation.
