title: Dark Mode - Flowbite React
description: Learn how to implement and customize dark mode in your React application using Flowbite and Tailwind CSS. Includes step-by-step instructions for theme switching, SSR support, and framework-specific integrations.
---

## Overview

Flowbite React provides built-in dark mode functionality that seamlessly integrates with popular full-stack frameworks like Next.js, Remix, Astro, and Gatsby. The dark mode implementation fully supports server-side rendering (SSR) and offers an intuitive developer experience.

## Dark Mode Toggle

The easiest way to implement dark mode in your application is by using the `DarkThemeToggle` component. This component automatically handles theme detection and provides a user-friendly interface for switching between light and dark modes.

```jsx
import { DarkThemeToggle } from "flowbite-react";

export default function MyPage() {
  return (
    // ...
    <DarkThemeToggle />
  );
}
```

## Theme Mode Hook

For more granular control over theme management, Flowbite React provides the `useThemeMode` hook. This powerful hook handles:

- Theme state management
- Automatic theme detection
- Theme persistence in LocalStorage
- Cross-tab theme synchronization

### Hook API

```tsx
type ThemeMode = "light" | "dark" | "auto";

declare const useThemeMode: () => {
  mode: ThemeMode;
  computedMode: ThemeMode; // "light" | "dark"
  setMode: (mode: ThemeMode) => void;
  toggleMode: () => void;
  clearMode: () => void;
};
```

### Features

1. **Automatic Theme Persistence**: Your users' theme preferences are automatically saved in the browser's LocalStorage
2. **Cross-Tab Synchronization**: Theme changes are instantly synchronized across all open browser tabs
3. **No Additional Configuration**: All features work out of the box
