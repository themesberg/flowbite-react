title: React Theme Prefix - Flowbite
description: Learn how you can change the Tailwind CSS classes prefix used by the components in Flowbite React
---

By following these steps, you can easily customize the Tailwind CSS prefix in your Flowbite React project, ensuring better compatibility with other CSS frameworks and avoiding class name conflicts.

## Setting the Prefix

### Flowbite React Configuration

To set a custom prefix for Flowbite React components, modify the `prefix` property in your `.flowbite-react/config.json` file:

```json
{
  "$schema": "https://unpkg.com/flowbite-react/schema.json",
  "components": [],
  "prefix": "tw"
}
```

### Tailwind CSS Configuration

When using a prefix, you must also configure it in your Tailwind CSS setup. The configuration syntax differs between Tailwind CSS versions:

#### Tailwind CSS v3 and v4

For v3, you can use any prefix including special characters:

```js
/** @type {import('tailwindcss').Config} */
export default {
  prefix: "tw-",
  // ... rest of your config
};
```

For v4, note that the prefix cannot contain special characters (like hyphens). Use simple strings like `tw` instead of `tw-`:

```css
@import "tailwindcss" prefix(tw);
```

## Update Your React Application

Next, render the `ThemeConfig` component at the **root of your app** with the same `prefix` property:

```tsx {1,6}
import { ThemeConfig } from "flowbite-react";

export default function App() {
  return (
    <>
      <ThemeConfig prefix="tw" />
      {/* ... */}
    </>
  );
}
```

This configuration will ensure that all Flowbite React components use the specified prefix for their Tailwind CSS classes. The prefix will be automatically applied to all component classes.
