This guide provides three ways to integrate Flowbite React with Meteor.js:

1. [Quick Start](#quick-start): Create a new project with everything pre-configured
2. [Add to Existing Project](#add-to-existing-project): Add Flowbite React to an existing Meteor project
3. [Manual Setup](#manual-setup): Set up everything from scratch manually

<TextDivider>Quick Start (Recommended)</TextDivider>

## Quick Start

The fastest way to get started is using our project creation CLI, which sets up a new Meteor project with Flowbite React, Tailwind CSS, and all necessary configurations:

```bash
npx create-flowbite-react@latest --template meteorjs
```

This will:

- Create a new Meteor project
- Install and configure Tailwind CSS
- Set up Flowbite React with all required dependencies
- Configure dark mode support
- Set up example components

## Add to Existing Project

If you already have a Meteor project and want to add Flowbite React, you can use our initialization CLI:

```bash
npx flowbite-react@latest init
```

This will automatically:

- Install Flowbite React and its dependencies
- Configure Tailwind CSS to include Flowbite React plugin
- Set up necessary configurations

<TextDivider>Manual Setup</TextDivider>

## Manual Setup

If you prefer to set everything up manually or need more control over the configuration, follow these steps:

### 1. Create Project

Create a new Meteor project:

For JavaScript:

```bash
meteor create meteor-project
cd meteor-project
```

For TypeScript:

```bash
meteor create meteor-project --typescript
cd meteor-project
```

### 2. Configure Tailwind CSS

Install Tailwind CSS and its peer dependencies:

```bash
npm install -D tailwindcss @tailwindcss/postcss postcss postcss-load-config
```

Create a `postcss.config.mjs` file:

```bash
touch postcss.config.mjs
```

Add `@tailwindcss/postcss` to your `postcss.config.mjs` file:

```js
/** @type {import('postcss-load-config').Config} */
const config = {
  plugins: {
    "@tailwindcss/postcss": {},
  },
};
export default config;
```

Update the css file `client/main.css` to include Tailwind CSS:

```css
@import "tailwindcss";
```

### 3. Install Flowbite React

Install Flowbite React:

```bash
npx flowbite-react@latest init
```

This will:

- Install Flowbite React and its dependencies
- Configure Tailwind CSS to include Flowbite React plugin

## Try it out

Now that you have successfully installed Flowbite React you can start using the components from the library. Create or update a component in your Meteor app:

```tsx
// imports/ui/App.tsx (or .jsx)
import { Button } from "flowbite-react";
import React from "react";

export const App = () => (
  <>
    <Button>Click me</Button>
  </>
);
```
