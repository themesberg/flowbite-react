description: Learn how to install Flowbite React for your Astro project and start building modern websites with a lightning fast and content-focused web framework
---

This guide provides three ways to integrate Flowbite React with Astro:

1. [Quick Start](#quick-start): Create a new project with everything pre-configured
2. [Add to Existing Project](#add-to-existing-project): Add Flowbite React to an existing Astro project
3. [Manual Setup](#manual-setup): Set up everything from scratch manually

<TextDivider>Quick Start (Recommended)</TextDivider>

## Quick Start

The fastest way to get started is using our project creation CLI, which sets up a new Astro project with Flowbite React, Tailwind CSS, and all necessary configurations:

```bash
npx create-flowbite-react@latest --template astro
```

This will:

- Create a new Astro project
- Install and configure Tailwind CSS
- Set up Flowbite React with all required dependencies
- Configure dark mode support
- Set up example components

## Add to Existing Project

If you already have an Astro project and want to add Flowbite React, you can use our initialization CLI:

```bash
npx flowbite-react@latest init
```

This will automatically:

- Install Flowbite React and its dependencies
- Configure Tailwind CSS to include Flowbite React plugin
- Set up dark mode support

<TextDivider>Manual Setup</TextDivider>

## Manual Setup

If you prefer to set everything up manually or need more control over the configuration, follow these steps:

### 1. Create Astro Project

Create a new Astro project:

```bash
npx create-astro@latest
```

### 2. Add React Support

Install React support using the Astro CLI:

```bash
npx astro add react
```

**Note:** Make sure to answer `Yes` to all the questions.

### 3. Configure Tailwind CSS

Install Tailwind CSS using the Astro CLI:

```bash
npx astro add tailwind
```

**Note:** Make sure to answer `Yes` to all the questions.

### 4. Install Flowbite React

Install Flowbite React:

```bash
npx flowbite-react@latest init
```

This will:

- Install Flowbite React and its dependencies
- Configure Tailwind CSS to include Flowbite React plugin
- Configure Vite to include Flowbite React plugin

### 5. Configure Dark Mode

To prevent dark mode flickering, add the `ThemeModeScript` component to your root layout:

```tsx
// src/layouts/index.astro
---
import { ThemeModeScript } from "flowbite-react";
---

<html lang="en">
  <head>
    <ThemeModeScript />
  </head>
  <body>
    <slot />
  </body>
</html>
```

Import and use the layout in your pages:

```tsx
// src/pages/index.astro
---
import RootLayout from "../layouts/index.astro";
---

<RootLayout>
  // Your content here
</RootLayout>
```

### 6. Component Hydration

By default, UI Framework components are not hydrated in the client. To make Flowbite React components interactive, add a `client:*` directive:

```tsx
<DarkThemeToggle client:load />
```

Available directives:

- `client:load`: Hydrates immediately on page load
- `client:idle`: Hydrates when the browser is idle
- `client:visible`: Hydrates when the component becomes visible

## Try it out

Now that you have successfully installed Flowbite React you can start using the components from the library:

```tsx
// src/pages/index.astro
---
import { Button } from "flowbite-react";
import RootLayout from "../layouts/index.astro";
---

<RootLayout>
  <Button>Click me</Button>
</RootLayout>
```
