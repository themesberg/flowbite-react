This guide provides three ways to integrate Flowbite React with Vike:

1. [Quick Start](#quick-start): Create a new project with everything pre-configured
2. [Add to Existing Project](#add-to-existing-project): Add Flowbite React to an existing Vike project
3. [Manual Setup](#manual-setup): Set up everything from scratch manually

## Quick Start

The fastest way to get started is using our project creation CLI, which sets up a new Vike project with Flowbite React, Tailwind CSS, and all necessary configurations:

```bash
npx create-flowbite-react@latest -t vike
```

This will:

- Create a new Vike project
- Install and configure Tailwind CSS
- Set up Flowbite React with all required dependencies
- Configure necessary plugins
- Set up example components

## Add to Existing Project

If you already have a Vike project and want to add Flowbite React, you can use our initialization CLI:

```bash
npx flowbite-react@latest init
```

This will automatically:

- Install Flowbite React and its dependencies
- Configure Tailwind CSS to include Flowbite React plugin
- Set up necessary configurations

## Manual Setup

If you prefer to set everything up manually or need more control over the configuration, follow these steps:

### 1. Create Project

Create a new Vike project using the official template:

```bash
npx create-vike@latest --react --tailwindcss
```

### 2. Install Flowbite React

Install Flowbite React:

```bash
npx flowbite-react@latest init
```

This will:

- Install Flowbite React and its dependencies
- Configure Tailwind CSS to include Flowbite React plugin
- Set up necessary configurations

## Try it out

Now that you have successfully installed Flowbite React you can start using the components from the library:

```tsx
// pages/index/+Page.tsx
import { Button } from "flowbite-react";

export default function Page() {
  return <Button>Click me</Button>;
}
```
