## Quick Start

The fastest way to get started is using our project creation CLI, which sets up a new Laravel project with Flowbite React, Tailwind CSS, and all necessary configurations:

```bash
npx create-flowbite-react@latest --template laravel
```

This will:

- Create a new Laravel project
- Install and configure Tailwind CSS
- Set up Flowbite React with all required dependencies
- Configure Inertia.js and React
- Set up example components

## Add to Existing Project

If you already have a Laravel project and want to add Flowbite React, you can use our initialization CLI:

```bash
npx flowbite-react@latest init
```

This will automatically:

- Install Flowbite React and its dependencies
- Configure Tailwind CSS to include Flowbite React plugin
- Set up necessary configurations

## Manual Setup

If you prefer to set everything up manually or need more control over the configuration, follow these steps:

### 1. Create Laravel Project

Create a new Laravel project with Inertia.js and React support:

```bash
laravel new flowbite-react-laravel --react
```

### 2. Install Flowbite React

Install Flowbite React:

```bash
npx flowbite-react@latest init
```

This will:

- Install Flowbite React and its dependencies
- Configure Tailwind CSS to include Flowbite React plugin
- Configure Vite to include Flowbite React plugin

## Try it out

Now that you have successfully installed Flowbite React you can start using the components from the library:

```jsx
// resources/js/pages/welcome.tsx
import { Button } from "flowbite-react";

export default function Welcome() {
  return <Button>Click me</Button>;
}
```
