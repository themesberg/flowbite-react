This guide provides three ways to integrate Flowbite React with Remix:

1. [Quick Start](#quick-start): Create a new project with everything pre-configured
2. [Add to Existing Project](#add-to-existing-project): Add Flowbite React to an existing Remix project
3. [Manual Setup](#manual-setup): Set up everything from scratch manually

<TextDivider>Quick Start (Recommended)</TextDivider>

## Quick Start

The fastest way to get started is using our project creation CLI, which sets up a new Remix project with Flowbite React, Tailwind CSS, and all necessary configurations:

```bash
npx create-flowbite-react@latest -t remix
```

This will:

- Create a new Remix project
- Install and configure Tailwind CSS
- Set up Flowbite React with all required dependencies
- Configure dark mode support
- Set up example components

## Add to Existing Project

If you already have a Remix project and want to add Flowbite React, you can use our initialization CLI:

```bash
npx flowbite-react@latest init
```

This will automatically:

- Install Flowbite React and its dependencies
- Configure Tailwind CSS to include Flowbite React plugin
- Set up necessary configurations for dark mode

<TextDivider>Manual Setup</TextDivider>

## Manual Setup

If you prefer to set everything up manually or need more control over the configuration, follow these steps:

### 1. Create Project

Create a new Remix project:

```bash
npx create-remix@latest
```

### 2. Install Flowbite React

Install Flowbite React:

```bash
npx flowbite-react@latest init
```

This will:

- Install Flowbite React and its dependencies
- Configure Tailwind CSS to include Flowbite React plugin
- Configure Vite to include Flowbite React plugin

### 3. Configure Dark Mode

In server-side rendered applications like Remix, to avoid page flicker (if `dark` mode is set) before Remix hydrates the content, the `ThemeModeScript` component must be rendered in the `<head>` tag.

`ThemeModeScript` renders a script tag that sets `dark` or removes `dark` from the `<html>` element before hydration occurs.

Import and render `ThemeModeScript` in `app/root.tsx` the `<head>` tag:

```tsx {1,8}
import { ThemeModeScript } from "flowbite-react";

export default function Layout() {
  return (
    <html lang="en">
      <head>
        {/* ... */}
        <ThemeModeScript />
      </head>
      <body>{/* ... */}</body>
    </html>
  );
}
```

## Try it out

Now that you have successfully installed Flowbite React you can start using the components from the library:

```tsx
// app/routes/_index.tsx

import { Button } from "flowbite-react";

export default function Index() {
  return <Button>Click me</Button>;
}
```
