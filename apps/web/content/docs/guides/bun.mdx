This guide provides three ways to integrate Flowbite React with Bun:

1. [Quick Start](#quick-start): Create a new project with everything pre-configured
2. [Add to Existing Project](#add-to-existing-project): Add Flowbite React to an existing Bun project
3. [Manual Setup](#manual-setup): Set up everything from scratch manually

## Quick Start

The fastest way to get started is using our project creation CLI, which sets up a new Bun project with Flowbite React, Tailwind CSS, and all necessary configurations:

```bash
npx create-flowbite-react@latest -t bun
```

This will:

- Create a new Bun project
- Install and configure Tailwind CSS
- Set up Flowbite React with all required dependencies
- Configure development and build scripts
- Set up example components

## Add to Existing Project

If you already have a Bun project and want to add Flowbite React, you can use our initialization CLI:

```bash
npx flowbite-react@latest init
```

This will automatically:

- Install Flowbite React and its dependencies
- Configure Tailwind CSS to include Flowbite React plugin
- Set up necessary build configurations

<TextDivider>Manual Setup</TextDivider>

## Manual Setup

If you prefer to set everything up manually or need more control over the configuration, follow these steps:

### 1. Create Bun Project

Create a new Bun project with React and Tailwind CSS:

```bash
mkdir my-app && cd my-app
bun init
```

When prompted:

- Select "React" for the project template
- Select "TailwindCSS" for the React template

### 2. Install Flowbite React

Install Flowbite React:

```bash
npx flowbite-react@latest init
```

This will:

- Install Flowbite React and its dependencies
- Configure Tailwind CSS to include Flowbite React plugin
- Configure Bun to include Flowbite React plugin
- Set up necessary build configurations

### 3. Configure Dark Mode

Add the `ThemeModeScript` component to prevent dark mode flickering:

```tsx
// src/main.tsx
import { ThemeModeScript } from "flowbite-react";
import React from "react";
import ReactDOM from "react-dom/client";
import App from "./App";

import "./index.css";

ReactDOM.createRoot(document.getElementById("root")!).render(
  <React.StrictMode>
    <ThemeModeScript />
    <App />
  </React.StrictMode>,
);
```

## Try it out

Now that you have successfully installed Flowbite React you can start using the components from the library:

```tsx
// src/App.tsx
import { Button } from "flowbite-react";

export default function App() {
  return <Button>Click me</Button>;
}
```
