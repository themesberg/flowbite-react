description: Learn how to install Flowbite React for your Vite project and start developing modern web applications with interactive components

This guide provides three ways to integrate Flowbite React with Vite:

1. [Quick Start](#quick-start): Create a new project with everything pre-configured
2. [Add to Existing Project](#add-to-existing-project): Add Flowbite React to an existing Vite project
3. [Manual Setup](#manual-setup): Set up everything from scratch manually

## Quick Start

The fastest way to get started is using our project creation CLI, which sets up a new Vite project with Flowbite React, Tailwind CSS, and all necessary configurations:

```bash
npx create-flowbite-react@latest -t vite
```

This will:

- Create a new Vite project
- Install and configure Tailwind CSS
- Set up Flowbite React with all required dependencies
- Configure necessary plugins
- Set up example components

## Add to Existing Project

If you already have a Vite project and want to add Flowbite React, you can use our initialization CLI:

```bash
npx flowbite-react@latest init
```

This will automatically:

- Install Flowbite React and its dependencies
- Configure Tailwind CSS to include Flowbite React plugin
- Set up necessary configurations

<TextDivider>Manual Setup</TextDivider>

## Manual Setup

If you prefer to set everything up manually or need more control over the configuration, follow these steps:

### 1. Create Project

Create a new Vite project with React and TypeScript:

```bash
npx create-vite@latest my-app
cd my-app
```

When prompted, select the "React" option.

### 2. Configure Tailwind CSS

1. Install Tailwind CSS and its Vite plugin:

```bash
npm install -D tailwindcss @tailwindcss/vite
```

2. Configure the Vite plugin in your `vite.config.ts`:

```ts {1,7}
import tailwindcss from "@tailwindcss/vite";
import react from "@vitejs/plugin-react";
import { defineConfig } from "vite";

// https://vite.dev/config/
export default defineConfig({
  plugins: [react(), tailwindcss()],
});
```

3. Add Tailwind CSS to your CSS file (`src/index.css`):

```css
@import "tailwindcss";
```

### 3. Install Flowbite React

Install Flowbite React:

```bash
npx flowbite-react@latest init
```

This will:

- Install Flowbite React and its dependencies
- Configure Tailwind CSS to include Flowbite React plugin
- Configure Vite to include Flowbite React plugin

## Try it out

Now that you have successfully installed Flowbite React you can start using the components from the library:

```tsx
// src/App.tsx
import { Button } from "flowbite-react";

export default function App() {
  return <Button>Click me</Button>;
}
```
