title: Use with Next.js - Flowbite React
description: Learn how to install Flowbite React for your Next.js project and start developing with the most popular React-based framework built by Vercel
---

This guide provides three ways to integrate Flowbite React with Next.js:

1. [Quick Start](#quick-start): Create a new project with everything pre-configured
2. [Add to Existing Project](#add-to-existing-project): Add Flowbite React to an existing Next.js project
3. [Manual Setup](#manual-setup): Set up everything from scratch manually

<TextDivider>Quick Start (Recommended)</TextDivider>

## Quick Start

The fastest way to get started is using our project creation CLI, which sets up a new Next.js project with Flowbite React, Tailwind CSS, and all necessary configurations:

```bash
npx create-flowbite-react@latest --template nextjs
```

This will:

- Create a new Next.js project
- Install and configure Tailwind CSS
- Set up Flowbite React with all required dependencies
- Configure dark mode support
- Set up example components

## Add to Existing Project

If you already have a Next.js project and want to add Flowbite React, you can use our initialization CLI:

```bash
npx flowbite-react@latest init
```

This will automatically:

- Install Flowbite React and its dependencies
- Configure Tailwind CSS to include Flowbite React plugin
- Set up necessary configurations

<TextDivider>Manual Setup</TextDivider>

## Manual Setup

If you prefer to set everything up manually or need more control over the configuration, follow these steps:

### 1. Create Project

Create a new Next.js project:

When prompted:

- Would you like to use Tailwind CSS? » Yes

```bash
npx create-next-app@latest
```

### 2. Install Flowbite React

Install Flowbite React:

```bash
npx flowbite-react@latest init
```

This will:

- Install Flowbite React and its dependencies
- Configure Tailwind CSS to include Flowbite React plugin
- Configure Vite to include Flowbite React plugin

### 3. Configure Dark Mode (Optional)

To avoid page flicker in dark mode before hydration, add the `ThemeModeScript` to your root layout:

For App Router:

```tsx
// app/layout.tsx
import { ThemeModeScript } from "flowbite-react";

export default function RootLayout({ children }) {
  return (
    <html suppressHydrationWarning>
      <head>
        <ThemeModeScript />
      </head>
      <body>{children}</body>
    </html>
  );
}
```

For Pages Router:

```tsx
// pages/_document.tsx
import { ThemeModeScript } from "flowbite-react";

export default function Document() {
  return (
    <Html suppressHydrationWarning>
      <Head>
        <ThemeModeScript />
      </Head>
      <body>
        <Main />
        <NextScript />
      </body>
    </Html>
  );
}
```

## Try it out

Now that you have successfully installed Flowbite React you can start using the components from the library:

```tsx
// app/page.tsx
import { Button } from "flowbite-react";

export default function Page() {
  return <Button>Click me</Button>;
}
```
