This guide provides three ways to integrate Flowbite React with RedwoodJS:

1. [Quick Start](#quick-start): Create a new project with everything pre-configured
2. [Add to Existing Project](#add-to-existing-project): Add Flowbite React to an existing RedwoodJS project
3. [Manual Setup](#manual-setup): Set up everything from scratch manually

## Quick Start

The fastest way to get started is using our project creation CLI, which sets up a new RedwoodJS project with Flowbite React, Tailwind CSS, and all necessary configurations:

```bash
npx create-flowbite-react@latest -t redwoodjs
```

This will:

- Create a new RedwoodJS project
- Install and configure Tailwind CSS
- Set up Flowbite React with all required dependencies
- Configure necessary project settings
- Set up example components

## Add to Existing Project

If you already have a RedwoodJS project and want to add Flowbite React, you can use our initialization CLI:

```bash
npx flowbite-react@latest init
```

This will automatically:

- Install Flowbite React and its dependencies
- Configure Tailwind CSS to include Flowbite React plugin
- Set up necessary configurations

<TextDivider>Manual Setup</TextDivider>

## Manual Setup

If you prefer to set everything up manually or need more control over the configuration, follow these steps:

### 1. Create Project

Create a new RedwoodJS project:

```bash
yarn create redwood-app my-redwood-app
cd my-redwood-app
yarn install
```

Create a new homepage using the CLI:

```bash
yarn redwood generate page home /
```

### 2. Configure Tailwind CSS

Install Tailwind CSS using the RedwoodJS CLI:

```bash
yarn rw setup ui tailwindcss
```

This will automatically:

- Install Tailwind CSS and its dependencies
- Create and configure the necessary Tailwind configuration files
- Update your CSS files to include Tailwind directives

### 3. Install Flowbite React

Setup VSCode using Flowbite React CLI:

```bash
npx flowbite-react@latest setup vscode
```

Install Flowbite React in `web` directory:

```bash
cd web && npx flowbite-react@latest init
```

This will:

- Install Flowbite React and its dependencies
- Configure Tailwind CSS to include Flowbite React plugin
- Configure Vite to include Flowbite React plugin

## Try it out

Now that you have successfully installed Flowbite React you can start using the components from the library:

```tsx
// web/src/pages/HomePage/HomePage.tsx
import { Button } from "flowbite-react";

export default function HomePage() {
  return (
    <>
      <Button>Click me</Button>
    </>
  );
}
```
