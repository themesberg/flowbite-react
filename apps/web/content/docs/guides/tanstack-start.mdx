3. [Manual Setup](#manual-setup): Set up everything from scratch manually

<TextDivider>Quick Start (Recommended)</TextDivider>

## Quick Start

The fastest way to get started is using our project creation CLI, which sets up a new TanStack Start project with Flowbite React, Tailwind CSS, and all necessary configurations:

```bash
npx create-flowbite-react@latest -t tanstack-start
```

This will:

- Create a new TanStack Start project
- Install and configure Tailwind CSS
- Set up Flowbite React with all required dependencies
- Configure example components

## Add to Existing Project

If you already have a TanStack Start project and want to add Flowbite React, you can use our initialization CLI:

```bash
npx flowbite-react@latest init
```

This will automatically:

- Install Flowbite React and its dependencies
- Configure Tailwind CSS to include Flowbite React plugin
- Set up necessary configurations

## Manual Setup

If you prefer to set everything up manually or need more control over the configuration, follow these steps:

### 1. Create Project

Create a new TanStack Start project:

```bash
npx degit https://github.com/tanstack/router/examples/react/start-basic start-basic
cd start-basic
```

### 2. Install Flowbite React

Install Flowbite React:

```bash
npx flowbite-react@latest init
```

This will:

- Install Flowbite React and its dependencies
- Configure Tailwind CSS to include Flowbite React plugin
- Configure Vite to include Flowbite React plugin

## Try it out

Now you can start using Flowbite React components in your application:

```tsx
// app/routes/index.tsx
import { createFileRoute } from "@tanstack/react-router";
import { Button } from "flowbite-react";

export const Route = createFileRoute("/")({
  component: Home,
});

function Home() {
  return (
    <div className="p-2">
      <Button>Click me</Button>
    </div>
  );
}
```
