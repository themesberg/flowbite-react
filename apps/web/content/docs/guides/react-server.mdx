---

This guide provides three ways to integrate Flowbite React with @lazarv/react-server:

1. [Quick Start](#quick-start): Create a new project with everything pre-configured
2. [Add to Existing Project](#add-to-existing-project): Add Flowbite React to an existing @lazarv/react-server project
3. [Manual Setup](#manual-setup): Set up everything from scratch manually

<TextDivider>Quick Start (Recommended)</TextDivider>

## Quick Start

The fastest way to get started is using our project creation CLI, which sets up a new @lazarv/react-server project with Flowbite React, Tailwind CSS, and all necessary configurations:

```bash
npx create-flowbite-react@latest -t react-server
```

This will:

- Create a new @lazarv/react-server project
- Install and configure Tailwind CSS
- Set up Flowbite React with all required dependencies
- Configure dark mode support
- Set up example components with proper client/server component separation

## Add to Existing Project

If you already have a @lazarv/react-server project and want to add Flowbite React, you can use our initialization CLI:

```bash
npx flowbite-react@latest init
```

This will automatically:

- Install Flowbite React and its dependencies
- Configure Tailwind CSS to include Flowbite React plugin
- Set up necessary configurations

<TextDivider>Manual Setup</TextDivider>

## Manual Setup

If you prefer to set everything up manually or need more control over the configuration, follow these steps:

### 1. Create Project

Create a new @lazarv/react-server project:

```bash
npx @lazarv/create-react-server@latest
```

### 2. Install Flowbite React

Install Flowbite React:

```bash
npx flowbite-react@latest init
```

This will:

- Install Flowbite React and its dependencies
- Configure Tailwind CSS to include Flowbite React plugin
- Configure Vite to include Flowbite React plugin

### 3. Configure Dark Mode (Optional)

To support dark mode in your application, add the `ThemeModeScript` to your root layout:

```tsx
// src/App.tsx
import { ThemeModeScript } from "flowbite-react";

export function App() {
  return (
    <html lang="en" className="h-screen" suppressHydrationWarning>
      <head>
        <ThemeModeScript />
      </head>
      {/* Rest of your app */}
    </html>
  );
}
```

## Try it out

Now that you have successfully installed Flowbite React, you can start using the components from the library:

```tsx
// src/App.tsx
import { Button } from "flowbite-react";

export default function App() {
  return (
    <html lang="en" className="h-screen" suppressHydrationWarning>
      <head></head>
      <body
        className="flex min-h-full w-full flex-col items-center justify-center dark:bg-zinc-900 dark:text-gray-400"
        suppressHydrationWarning
      >
        <Button>Click me</Button>
      </body>
    </html>
  );
}
```
