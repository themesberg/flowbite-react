description: Learn how to use Flowbite React components inside React Server Components
---

React Server Components individually fetch data and render entirely on the server, and the resulting HTML is streamed into the client-side React component tree.

RSCs can help reduce the size of the client-side JavaScript bundle and improve loading performance.

## Usage

Without `"use client"` directive:

```jsx
import { Button } from "flowbite-react";

function Component() {
  return <Button>Default</Button>;
}
```

With `"use client"` directive:

```jsx
"use client";

import { Button } from "flowbite-react";

function Component() {
  return <Button onClick={() => console.log("clicked!")}>Default</Button>;
}
```

Incorrect: without `"use client"` directive and user event passed as prop (`onClick`) resulting in error:

```jsx
// errors

import { Button } from "flowbite-react";

function Component() {
  return <Button onClick={() => console.log("clicked!")}>Default</Button>;
}
```

## Support

All Flowbite React components are server-ready, meaning they can be rendered inside React Server Components without the need of `"use client"` directive at the top of the file.

## Notes

User event props (such as `onClick`, `onBlur`, ...etc) DO NOT work in React Server Components.

To pass any user events to a Flowbite React component (such as `onClick`, `onBlur`) the parent component must have the `"use client"` directive.

Only serializable data can be passed to a server component as props (eg: functions will not work).
