[Flowbite React](https://github.com/themesberg/flowbite-react) is a free and open-source UI component library based on the core Flowbite components and built with React components and interactivity handling.

This library features hundreds of interactive elements such as navbars, dropdowns, modals, and sidebars all handled by React and based on the utility classes from Tailwind CSS.

## Getting started

Learn how to get started with Flowbite React and start leveraging the interactive React components coupled with Flowbite and Tailwind CSS.

### Setup Tailwind CSS

### Install Flowbite React

1. Run the following command to install `flowbite-react`:

```bash
npm i flowbite-react

2. Add `flowbite-react/tailwind` plugin to `tailwind.config.js`:

/** @type {import('tailwindcss').Config} */
module.exports = {
  plugins: [
    // ...
    flowbite,
  ],
