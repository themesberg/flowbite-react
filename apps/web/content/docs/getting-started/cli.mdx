## Overview

The Flowbite React CLI provides a comprehensive set of tools for:

- Creating new Flowbite React projects
- Setting up Flowbite React in existing projects
- Managing development workflows
- Handling class generation
- Configuring your development environment

## Installation & Setup

### 1. Create a New Project

To scaffold a new Flowbite React application:

```bash
npx create-flowbite-react@latest
```

The CLI will guide you through:

- Project directory name
- Template selection
- Git repository initialization

### 2. Add to Existing Project

To integrate Flowbite React into an existing project:

```bash
npx flowbite-react@latest init
```

This command performs several automated setup steps:

- Verifies Tailwind CSS installation
- Installs Flowbite React dependencies
- Configures Tailwind CSS
- Creates the `.flowbite-react` config directory
- Creates `config.json` and `.gitignore` files in the config directory
- Creates `.vscode/settings.json` and `.vscode/extensions.json` files
- Sets up bundler-specific plugins

## CLI Commands

### `flowbite-react build`

Generates the class list for your components. This command:

- Creates the `.flowbite-react` output directory if it doesn't exist
- Generates a comprehensive list of Tailwind classes used in your components
- Analyzes your project files to find component imports if no components are explicitly defined in your config
- Writes the generated class list to `.flowbite-react/class-list.json`
- This class list is used by the Tailwind plugin to ensure all component classes are included in your CSS

### `flowbite-react create`

Creates a new component with the proper structure and theming setup.

The `create` command uses the configuration options from `.flowbite-react/config.json` to determine:

1. **Where to create the component** (`path`):

   - Determines the directory where the component will be created
   - Default: `"src/components"`
   - Example: With `"path": "src/ui/elements"`, the component will be created at `src/ui/elements/button.tsx`

2. **Language format** (`tsx`):

   - When `true`: Creates a TypeScript component (`.tsx`) with full type definitions
   - When `false`: Creates a JavaScript component (`.jsx`) without TypeScript syntax
   - Default: `true`
   - Example: With `"tsx": false`, the component will be created as `button.jsx` with JavaScript syntax

3. **React Server Components support** (`rsc`):
   - When `true`: Adds the `"use client";` directive at the top of the component file
   - When `false`: Omits the directive for client-only components
   - Default: `true`
   - Example: With `"rsc": false`, the component won't include the `"use client";` directive

The generated component includes:

- Proper theme structure with base styles
- Theme resolution with the Flowbite React theming system
- Component props with proper typing (in TypeScript mode)
- Forward ref implementation for DOM access
- Display name for better debugging

### `flowbite-react dev`

Starts the development mode which:

- Watches for component changes
- Automatically updates class lists
- Provides real-time class generation
- Monitors imported components

### `flowbite-react init`

Initializes Flowbite React in your project. This command:

- Ensures Tailwind CSS is installed
- Creates the `.flowbite-react` config directory
- Creates `config.json` and `.gitignore` files in the config directory
- Creates `.vscode/settings.json` and `.vscode/extensions.json` files
- Detects and configures your bundler with the appropriate plugin
- Adds postinstall script to `package.json` (if no bundler detected)

### `flowbite-react install`

Installs Flowbite React in your project:

- Detects your package manager (npm, yarn, pnpm, bun, etc.)
- Installs the latest version of flowbite-react
- Skips installation if already installed

### `flowbite-react register`

Registers the Flowbite React process for development:

- Runs the dev process in the background
- Manages process lifecycle
- Handles automatic class generation
- Creates and maintains process ID file

### `flowbite-react setup plugin`

Sets up the appropriate bundler plugin for your project:

- Detects your bundler configuration file
- Supports multiple bundlers (Bun, ESBuild, Parcel, Rsbuild, Rspack, Vite, Webpack, etc.)
- Adds the Flowbite React plugin to your bundler config
- Configures plugin settings automatically

### `flowbite-react setup tailwindcss`

Configures Tailwind CSS for use with Flowbite React:

- Sets up Tailwind CSS v3 or v4 configuration
- Adds necessary plugin configurations
- Updates content paths for component styles
- Configures class generation settings

### `flowbite-react setup vscode`

Sets up VSCode for optimal development:

- Configures Tailwind CSS IntelliSense
- Sets up file associations
- Adds recommended extensions
- Configures class attribute settings

## Configuration

### Bundler Integration

The CLI automatically detects and configures popular bundlers:

- Farm
- Parcel
- Rolldown
- Rollup
- Rsbuild
- Rspack
- Turbopack
- Vite
- Webpack

Each bundler plugin automatically handles class generation by:

- Running the `flowbite-react dev` command during development
- Running the `flowbite-react build` command during production builds
- Watching for component changes and updating class lists in real-time
- Managing the class generation process lifecycle

This means you don't need to manually run these commands - the bundler plugin takes care of everything automatically.

### Configuration Options

The CLI creates a `.flowbite-react/config.json` file with several configuration options:

```json
{
  "$schema": "https://unpkg.com/flowbite-react/schema.json",
  "components": [],
  "path": "src/components",
  "prefix": "",
  "rsc": true,
  "tsx": true
}
```

#### `components`

List of component names to generate styles for. An empty array enables automatic detection.

#### `path`

Path where components will be created, relative to the project root. Default is `"src/components"`.

#### `prefix`

Optional prefix to apply to all Tailwind CSS classes.

#### `rsc`

Whether to include the `"use client"` directive for React Server Components. Default is `true`.

#### `tsx`

Whether to use TypeScript (.tsx) or JavaScript (.jsx) for component creation. Default is `true`.

### VSCode Integration

The CLI sets up VSCode for optimal development:

- Configures Tailwind CSS IntelliSense
- Sets up file associations
- Recommends essential extensions
- Configures class attribute settings

### Project Structure

The CLI creates and manages:

- `.flowbite-react/` directory for configuration
- Class list generation
- Bundler-specific configurations
- Git ignore rules

## Command Line Options

When creating new projects:

```bash
create-flowbite-react <project-directory> [options]

Options:
--template <n>   # Specify template
--git           # Initialize git repository
--help (-h)     # Show help
--version (-v)  # Show version
```

Example:

```bash
npx create-flowbite-react my-app --template nextjs --git
```

## Development Workflow

The CLI enhances your development workflow by:

1. Watching for component changes
2. Automatically generating class lists
3. Updating configurations in real-time
4. Managing bundler integrations
5. Providing VSCode optimizations

For the best development experience, ensure you have the recommended VSCode extensions installed and your bundler is properly configured.
