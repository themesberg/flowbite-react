description: Learn about the powerful CLI tools for managing and developing Flowbite React applications
---

## Overview

The Flowbite React CLI provides a comprehensive set of tools for:

- Creating new Flowbite React projects
- Setting up Flowbite React in existing projects
- Managing development workflows
- Handling class generation
- Configuring your development environment

## Installation & Setup

### 1. Create a New Project

To scaffold a new Flowbite React application:

```bash
npx create-flowbite-react@latest
```

The CLI will guide you through:

- Project directory name
- Template selection
- Git repository initialization

### 2. Add to Existing Project

To integrate Flowbite React into an existing project:

```bash
npx flowbite-react@latest init
```

This command performs several automated setup steps:

- Verifies Tailwind CSS installation
- Installs Flowbite React dependencies
- Configures Tailwind CSS
- Creates the `.flowbite-react` config directory
- Creates `config.json` and `.gitignore` files in the config directory
- Creates `.vscode/settings.json` and `.vscode/extensions.json` files
- Sets up bundler-specific plugins

## CLI Commands

### `flowbite-react init`

Initializes Flowbite React in your project. This command:

- Ensures Tailwind CSS is installed
- Creates the `.flowbite-react` config directory
- Creates `config.json` and `.gitignore` files in the config directory
- Creates `.vscode/settings.json` and `.vscode/extensions.json` files
- Detects and configures your bundler with the appropriate plugin
- Adds postinstall script to `package.json` (if no bundler detected)

### `flowbite-react build`

Generates the class list for your components. This:

- Creates the output directory if needed
- Generates a comprehensive list of Tailwind classes used in your components

### `flowbite-react dev`

Starts the development mode which:

- Watches for component changes
- Automatically updates class lists
- Provides real-time class generation
- Monitors imported components

### `flowbite-react register`

Registers the Flowbite React process for development:

- Runs the dev process in the background
- Manages process lifecycle
- Handles automatic class generation

## Project Templates

The CLI supports various framework templates. Each template comes with a complete guide and example implementation:

```bash
adonisjs         # AdonisJS          https://github.com/themesberg/flowbite-react-template-adonisjs
astro            # Astro             https://github.com/themesberg/flowbite-react-template-astro

gatsby           # Gatsby            https://github.com/themesberg/flowbite-react-template-gatsby
laravel          # Laravel           https://github.com/themesberg/flowbite-react-template-laravel
modernjs         # Modern.js         https://github.com/themesberg/flowbite-react-template-modernjs
nextjs           # Next.js           https://github.com/themesberg/flowbite-react-template-nextjs

redwoodjs        # RedwoodJS         https://github.com/themesberg/flowbite-react-template-redwoodjs
remix            # Remix             https://github.com/themesberg/flowbite-react-template-remix
rolldown         # Rolldown          https://github.com/themesberg/flowbite-react-template-rolldown
rollup           # Rollup            https://github.com/themesberg/flowbite-react-template-rollup
rsbuild          # Rsbuild           https://github.com/themesberg/flowbite-react-template-rsbuild
rspack           # Rspack            https://github.com/themesberg/flowbite-react-template-rspack
tanstack         # TanStack          https://github.com/themesberg/flowbite-react-template-tanstack
tanstack-router  # TanStack Router   https://github.com/themesberg/flowbite-react-template-tanstack-router
tanstack-start   # TanStack Start    https://github.com/themesberg/flowbite-react-template-tanstack-start
vite             # Vite              https://github.com/themesberg/flowbite-react-template-vite
webpack          # Webpack           https://github.com/themesberg/flowbite-react-template-webpack
```

You can use any of these templates with the `--template` flag:

```bash
npx create-flowbite-react my-app --template nextjs
```

## Configuration

### Bundler Integration

The CLI automatically detects and configures popular bundlers:

- Astro
- Farm
- Modern.js
- Next.js
- Parcel
- Rolldown
- Rollup
- Rsbuild
- Rspack
- TanStack
- Vite
- Webpack

Each bundler plugin automatically handles class generation by:

- Running the `flowbite-react dev` command during development
- Running the `flowbite-react build` command during production builds
- Watching for component changes and updating class lists in real-time
- Managing the class generation process lifecycle

This means you don't need to manually run these commands - the bundler plugin takes care of everything automatically.

### VSCode Integration

The CLI sets up VSCode for optimal development:

- Configures Tailwind CSS IntelliSense
- Sets up file associations
- Recommends essential extensions
- Configures class attribute settings

### Project Structure

The CLI creates and manages:

- `.flowbite-react/` directory for configuration
- Class list generation
- Bundler-specific configurations
- Git ignore rules

## Command Line Options

When creating new projects:

```bash
create-flowbite-react <project-directory> [options]

Options:
--template <n>   # Specify template
--git           # Initialize git repository
--help (-h)     # Show help
--version (-v)  # Show version
```

Example:

```bash
npx create-flowbite-react my-app --template nextjs --git
```

## Development Workflow

The CLI enhances your development workflow by:

1. Watching for component changes
2. Automatically generating class lists
3. Updating configurations in real-time
4. Managing bundler integrations
5. Providing VSCode optimizations

For the best development experience, ensure you have the recommended VSCode extensions installed and your bundler is properly configured.
