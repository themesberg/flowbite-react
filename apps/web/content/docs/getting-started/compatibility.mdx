description: Learn about Flowbite React's compatibility with Tailwind CSS versions and how to easily migrate between Tailwind CSS v3 and v4
---

Flowbite React is designed to work seamlessly with both Tailwind CSS v3 and v4, automatically detecting which version you're using in your project.

## Version Compatibility

Flowbite React features automatic version detection that allows it to:

- **Work with Tailwind CSS v3**: Full compatibility with Tailwind CSS v3.x projects
- **Support Tailwind CSS v4**: Ready for the latest features in Tailwind CSS v4
- **Adapt automatically**: No manual configuration needed to specify which version you're using

This means you can use Flowbite React in both existing Tailwind CSS v3 projects and new Tailwind CSS v4 projects without worrying about compatibility issues.

## Migrating from Tailwind CSS v3 to v4

If you have an existing project using Flowbite React with Tailwind CSS v3 and want to upgrade to Tailwind CSS v4, the process is straightforward:

1. Run the official Tailwind CSS upgrade command:

```bash
npx @tailwindcss/upgrade
```

2. Follow any additional instructions provided by the upgrade tool

3. That's it! Flowbite React will automatically detect that you're now using Tailwind CSS v4 and adapt accordingly

If you encounter any issues with compatibility, please check our [GitHub repository](https://github.com/themesberg/flowbite-react) for the latest updates or to report problems.
