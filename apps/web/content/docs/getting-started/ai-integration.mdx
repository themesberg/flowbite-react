Flowbite React provides powerful, built-in support for AI and Large Language Model (LLM) integration through specialized routes that expose documentation in machine-readable formats. These features enable seamless integration with ChatGPT, Claude, and other AI assistants.

## Compliance

Flowbite React follows the [llms.txt standard](https://llmstxt.org/), a community-driven proposal initiated by Jeremy Howard that standardizes how websites provide LLM-friendly information.

Our implementation helps address the fundamental challenge that language models face: context windows are too small to process entire websites, and HTML content with navigation, ads, and JavaScript is difficult to convert to LLM-friendly formats.

By adopting this standard, Flowbite React ensures that AI assistants can efficiently access our documentation without struggling with complex HTML or excessive content.

## Machine-Readable Routes

### LLM-Optimized Endpoints

- **`https://flowbite-react.com/llms.txt`** - A concise version of the documentation specifically optimized for LLM consumption and context-efficient prompting
- **`https://flowbite-react.com/llms-full.txt`** - The complete documentation in a format suitable for comprehensive LLM processing when token limits aren't a concern

### Markdown API Access

All documentation pages can be accessed in pure markdown format by simply appending `.md` to their URLs. For example:

- `https://flowbite-react.com/docs/getting-started/introduction.md`
- `https://flowbite-react.com/docs/components/button.md`
- `https://flowbite-react.com/docs/customize/theme.md`

## Implementation Examples

Here's how you might leverage these features in your AI integration:

```ts
// Fetching LLM-optimized documentation for context-efficient prompting
const llmDocs = await fetch("https://flowbite-react.com/llms.txt").then((res) => res.text());

// Getting full documentation for comprehensive LLM processing
const fullDocs = await fetch("https://flowbite-react.com/llms-full.txt").then((res) => res.text());

// Accessing specific component documentation in markdown format
const buttonDocs = await fetch("https://flowbite-react.com/docs/components/button.md").then((res) => res.text());

// Using markdown documentation in a ChatGPT prompt
const chatGptPrompt = `Based on this Flowbite React Button component documentation:
${buttonDocs}

Generate a code example for a primary button with an icon.`;
```

These features make it easy to integrate Flowbite React's documentation with modern AI systems, creating powerful, intelligent tools to enhance developer experience and productivity.
