title: Quickstart - Flowbite React
description: Learn how to get started with the free and open-source Flowbite React UI component library based on the utility classes from Tailwind CSS
---

## Getting started

You can install Flowbite React to any Node.js project.

You'll need to be familiar with Node.js, and have it installed.

## Setup Tailwind CSS

Install Tailwind CSS:

```bash
npm i autoprefixer postcss tailwindcss
npx tailwindcss init -p
```

Point Tailwind CSS to files you have `className=".."` in:

```javascript
module.exports = {
  content: ['./src/**/*.{js,jsx,ts,tsx}' /* src folder, for example */],
  theme: {
    extend: {},
  },
  plugins: [],
};
```

Add Tailwind CSS to a CSS file:

```css
@tailwind base;
@tailwind components;
@tailwind utilities;
```

## Install Flowbite React

1. Run the following command to install `flowbite-react`:

```bash
npm i flowbite-react
```

2. Add the Flowbite plugin to `tailwind.config.js`, and include content from `flowbite-react`:

```js
/** @type {import('tailwindcss').Config} */
export default {
  content: [
    // ...
    'node_modules/flowbite-react/lib/esm/**/*.js',
  ],
  plugins: [
    // ...
    require('flowbite/plugin'),
  ],
};
```

## Try it out

How you use Flowbite React depends on your project setup. In general, you can just import the components you want to use from `flowbite-react` and use them in a React `.jsx` file:

```tsx
import { Button } from 'flowbite-react';

export default function MyPage() {
  return (
    <div>
      <Button>Click me</Button>
    </div>
  );
}
```
