# Breaking changes

- removed `flowbite-react patch` CLI command

## Changes

- `flowbite-react/.gitignore`, `flowbite-react/config.json` self manages, regenerates and repairs
- new generated file `init.(jsx|tsx)` in `.flowbite-react/` directory that syncs up values from `config.json` that also are needed in React app runtime (similar to how a React context works)
  - synced on CLI commands: `init`, `build`, `dev`, `register`
- If you have custom configuration in `.flowbite-react/config.json` (different `dark`/`prefix`/`version` values), you must render `<ThemeInit />` at the root level of your app to sync runtime with node config values
  - notify users to include `<ThemeInit />` at the root level if custom `dark`, `prefix`, or `version` values are detected in the configuration file
- expose `flowbite-react/store` import path
- check if `flowbite-react` is installed when `npx flowbite-react@latest init`
  - bump the version to latest if below `0.11.x`
- remove redundant `{ flag: "w" }` in `fs.writeFile`
- update `dark-mode.md` and `prefix.md` documentation to reflect the `<ThemeInit />` changes
- add Tailwind CSS version support in theme mode handling and fix dark theme toggle class in Tailwind CSS v4

## Migration Guide

1. Remove `flowbite-react patch` from your `package.json`

   ```diff
   {
     "scripts": {
   -   "postinstall": "flowbite-react patch"
     }
   }
   ```

2. Add `<ThemeInit />` (import from `.flowbite-react/init.(jsx|tsx)`) at the root level of your app if you have custom configuration in `.flowbite-react/config.json` (different `dark`/`prefix`/`version` values).
