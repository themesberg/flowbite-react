import { CodePreview } from '~/app/components/code-preview';
import { ExampleAdditionalContent } from './additional-content.tsx';
import { HiInformationCircle } from 'react-icons/hi';
import { Alert } from '~/src';

The alert component can be used to show a contextual text to the user such as a success or error message after form validation inside an alert box where you can choose from multiple colors, sizes, and styles.

The examples below are styled with Tailwind CSS and the reactivity is handled by React and you can also add any type of content inside the alert box.

To start using the alert component you need to import the `<Alert>` component from the `flowbite-react` package:

```jsx
'use client';

import { Alert } from 'flowbite-react';
```

## Default alert

The default alert component is a simple alert box with a text inside it and you can use the `color` prop to change the color of the alert box and the `title` prop to add a title to the alert box.

Inside of the `<Alert>` component you can add any type of content such as text, images, or other components as they will be considered children of the alert box.

<CodePreview title="Default alert">
  <Alert color="info">
    <span>
      <span className="font-medium">Info alert!</span> Change a few things up and try submitting again.
    </span>
  </Alert>
</CodePreview>

## Alert with icon

Use the `icon` prop to add an icon to the alert box and you can use any icon from the [React Icons](https://react-icons.github.io/react-icons/) library.

<CodePreview title="Alert with icon">
  <Alert color="failure" icon={HiInformationCircle}>
    <span>
      <span className="font-medium">Info alert!</span> Change a few things up and try submitting again.
    </span>
  </Alert>
</CodePreview>

## Dismissable alert

You can use the `onDismiss` prop on the `<Alert>` component to add a dismiss button to the alert box by adding a function inside of it that will be called when the user clicks on the dismiss button.

<CodePreview title="Dismissable alert">
  <Alert color="success" onDismiss={() => alert('Alert dismissed!')}>
    <span>
      <span className="font-medium">Info alert!</span> Change a few things up and try submitting again.
    </span>
  </Alert>
</CodePreview>

## Rounded alert

To make the alert box rounded you can use the `rounded` prop on the `<Alert>` component.

<CodePreview title="Rounded">
  <Alert color="warning" rounded>
    <span>
      <span className="font-medium">Info alert!</span> Change a few things up and try submitting again.
    </span>
  </Alert>
</CodePreview>

## Border accent

Add a border accent to the alert box by applying the `withBorderAccent` prop on the `<Alert>` component.

<CodePreview title="Border accent">
  <Alert color="warning" withBorderAccent>
    <span>
      <span className="font-medium">Info alert!</span> Change a few things up and try submitting again.
    </span>
  </Alert>
</CodePreview>

## Additional content

Add additional content by using the `additionalContent` prop and add any type of content inside of it.

<CodePreview title="Additional content">
  <Alert additionalContent={<ExampleAdditionalContent />} color="warning" icon={HiInformationCircle}>
    <span>
      <span className="font-medium">Info alert!</span> Change a few things up and try submitting again.
    </span>
  </Alert>
</CodePreview>

## All options

This is an example with all of the available options and props for the alert component.

<CodePreview title="All options">
  <Alert
    additionalContent={<ExampleAdditionalContent />}
    color="success"
    icon={HiInformationCircle}
    onDismiss={() => alert('Alert dismissed!')}
    rounded
  >
    <span>
      <span className="font-medium">Info alert!</span> Change a few things up and try submitting again.
    </span>
  </Alert>
</CodePreview>
