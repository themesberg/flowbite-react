          The main difference is that the core components from Flowbite are open source under the MIT license, whereas
          Tailwind UI is a paid product. Another difference is that Flowbite relies on smaller and standalone
          components, whereas Tailwind UI offers sections of pages.

        <p className="mb-2 text-gray-500 dark:text-gray-400">
          However, we actually recommend using both Flowbite, Flowbite Pro, and even Tailwind UI as there is no
          technical reason stopping you from using the best of two worlds.
