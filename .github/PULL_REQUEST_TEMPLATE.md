- [ ] I have followed the [Your First Code Contribution section of the Contributing guide](https://github.com/themesberg/flowbite-react/blob/main/CONTRIBUTING.md#your-first-code-contribution)

Summarize the changes made and the motivation behind them.

Reference related issues using `#` followed by the issue number.

If there are breaking API changes - like adding or removing props, or changing the structure of the theme - describe them, and provide steps to update existing code.
